Abstract:
    We present new high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data on the M31
    globular cluster (GC) system, obtained with the Hectospec multifiber
    spectrograph on the 6.5m MMT. More than 300 clusters have been
    observed at a resolution of 5{AA} and with a median S/N of 75 per{AA},
    providing velocities with a median uncertainty of 6km/s. The primary
    focus of this paper is the determination of mean cluster
    metallicities, ages, and reddenings. Metallicities were estimated
    using a calibration of Lick indices with [Fe/H] provided by Galactic
    GCs.

Description:
    Subsequent to the publication of Paper I, more HST images of M31
    clusters became available, which were inspected closely to further 
    aid in the classification of objects in the cluster catalog.

    The Web site
    http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/oir/eg/m31clusters/M31_Hectospec.html
    contains images for all old clusters, young clusters, stars and
    background galaxies in the catalog of Paper I and may be profitably
    used to view individual cluster images as an adjunct to the
    spectroscopy of this paper.

    The data were all taken at the MMT with the Hectospec multifiber
    spectrograph during the years 2004-2007.

    Subsequent to the Hectospec project, a HectoChelle project of many of
    these same targets was initiated (J. Strader & N. Caldwell 2011, in
    preparation), resulting in more precise velocities which allowed us to
    refine the Hectospec velocity zero points.

Note (1): Flags as follows:
   d = The HectoChelle velocity for B070-G133 is significantly different, -222.9
   f = The HectoChelle velocity for B132-NB15 is significantly different, 70.8
   g = The HectoChelle velocity for B262 is significantly different, -340.3
   h = The HectoChelle velocity for NB21 is significantly different, -748.1
   i = Velocity for this cluster comes from HectoChelle
   j = Probably bound to NGC 205
Note (2):
   ) = Indicates value was not derived here. Such values are either the mode
    of all clusters, 0.13, or come from Barmby et al. (2000, Cat. J/AJ/119/727).
Note (3): Uncertainties are 2Gyr for measured ages.
  * A value of exactly 14Gyr means the age could not be determined,
    either because the metallicity was lower than -0.95 or the data point fell
    off of the grids shown in Figure 10.
  * A blank entry means that we have no blue spectrum or HST image of the 
    object to estimate the age, but that the red spectrum or the ground-based
    image do indicate an old age.
Note (4): Additional notes as follows:
  e = the spectrum shows weak emission
  w = the spectrum was weak
  r = we have only a red spectrum. For either this or the "w" case, no age
      or metallicity was derived, and it is possible some of these are not
      in fact old
  x = age could not be determined

Note (1): Notes as follows:
   b = New cluster not listed in Paper I (J/AJ/137/94)
   c = The coordinates for B257D-D073 have been corrected from
       Paper I (J/AJ/137/94)
   d = The velocity for DAO84 in Paper I was incorrect due to an automatic
       misidentification of emission lines, and thus this young cluster was
       erroneously identified as a background galaxy. We thank Paul Hodge for
       helping us identify this error. No other object listed in the tables of
       Paper I has this particular error.
Note (2): Where we could not determine new reddenings because the spectra could
   not be accurately fluxed (some observations were taken with a malfunctioning
   ADC), we use the modal reddening of E(B-V)=0.13.
Note (3): Clusters without ages have spectra too poor to determine one, but the
    age is expected to be younger than 3Gyr based on the continuum shape or the
    cluster's HST image. Uncertainties in age are roughly a factor of 2.
